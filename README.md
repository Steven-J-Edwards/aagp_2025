# 2025 AAGP Conference â€“ Predictive Modeling Workshop

Welcome to the temporary repository for the **Predictive Modeling Workshop** held at the 2025 AAGP Conference on **Thursday, June 12**.

## Workshop Datasets

This repository contains two datasets for use during the hands-on portion of the workshop:

- `housing_train.csv`
- `housing_test.csv`
